# Anime-Recommender-with-your-Mood

Recommendation system plays an important role in various industries such as music applications,
video platforms, food delivery and so on. After I learnt from different kinds of methods to implement
recommendation systems, I consider that the limitation of these methods exist because the data and
reference that they used in these methods do not include the userâ€™s mood at the moment they are
watching or using the product. Therefore, in this project plan, not only understanding some of the
recommendation methods, I would also like to develop a more advanced recommendation engine by
combining the real-time emotion detection and gesture recognition system with these methods.

## METHODOLOGY
### Recommendation System Methods
1. Popular-based approach
2. Content-based filtering approach
3. Collaborative filtering using k-Nearest Neighbors approach

### Emotion classification and detection
1. CNN model
2. vgg16
3. Resnet50
4.mobilenet

### User gesture recognition
