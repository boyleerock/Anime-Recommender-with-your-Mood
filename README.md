# Anime-Recommender-with-your-Mood

Recommendation system plays an important role in various industries such as music applications,
video platforms, food delivery and so on. After I learnt from different kinds of methods to implement
recommendation systems, I consider that the limitation of these methods exist because the data and
reference that they used in these methods do not include the userâ€™s mood at the moment they are
watching or using the product. Therefore, in this project plan, not only understanding some of the
recommendation methods, I would also like to develop a more advanced recommendation engine by
combining the real-time emotion detection and gesture recognition system with these methods.

## METHODOLOGY
### Recommendation System Methods
1. [Popular-based approach](https://github.com/boyleerock/Anime-Recommender-with-your-Mood/blob/main/Popular_based_rc.ipynb)
2. [Content-based filtering approach](https://github.com/boyleerock/Anime-Recommender-with-your-Mood/blob/main/cosinesimilarity_rs.ipynb)
3. [Collaborative filtering using k-Nearest Neighbors approach](https://github.com/boyleerock/Anime-Recommender-with-your-Mood/blob/main/Collaborative_filtering_knn.ipynb)

### Emotion classification and detection
1. [CNN model](https://github.com/boyleerock/Anime-Recommender-with-your-Mood/blob/main/emotions.py)
2. [vgg16](https://github.com/boyleerock/Anime-Recommender-with-your-Mood/blob/main/vgg16.ipynb)
3. [Resnet50](https://github.com/boyleerock/Anime-Recommender-with-your-Mood/blob/main/resnet50.ipynb)
